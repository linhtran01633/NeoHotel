Our first thought is &quot;lantern&quot; - a decoration item, a childhood toy which all Vietnamese people love.\n\n We can see lanterns easily at Hoi An ancient town as they are hung in front of the houses, and along the streets. The lanterns made Hoi An special and nostalgic vibe which tourists are impressed all the times. In the big cities as Ho Chi Minh, we rarely see a lantern except Mid-Autumn season (September in Lunar calendar), however, they have been never ever forgotten, as they always bring us beautiful memories. We would like to share this to valued guests all over the world by the warm heart and skillful hospitality from our team.\n\n We renovated the old hotel in 2023 with the hope: &quot;lantern&quot; will become a part of your trip to Vietnam.",
